It can be used to determine defined filename\nextensions for MIME types, or to use filename extensions to look up the likely\nMIME type definitions.\n\nMIME content types are used in MIME-compliant communications, as in e-mail or\nHTTP traffic, to indicate the type of content which is transmitted. The\nmime-types library provides the ability for detailed information about MIME\nentities (provided as an enumerable collection of MIME::Type objects) to be\ndetermined and used programmatically. There are many types defined by RFCs and\nvendors, so the list is long but by definition incomplete; don't hesitate to to\nadd additional type definitions (see Contributing.rdoc). The primary sources\nfor MIME type definitions found in mime-types is the IANA collection of\nregistrations (see below for the link), RFCs, and W3C recommendations.\n\nThe mime-types library uses semantic versioning. This is release 2.0; there are\nincompatible changes in the API provided by mime-types, mostly around registry\ninitialization (see History.rdoc for full details), and the removal of support\nfor Ruby 1.8 interpreters.\n\nmime-types (previously called MIME::Types for Ruby) was originally based on\nMIME::Types for Perl by Mark Overmeer, copyright 2001 - 2009.
